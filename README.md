### CPSC233-SRJRI
CPSC233 final project - T08 Group 3

#### Description
This project is a turn-based strategy game wherein the player controls a character in a two-dimensional board and seeks to win the game by lowering all their opponents hp (hit-points) to 0. This game is single-player only and all opponents are computer-controlled mnon-player characters that are not aligned with each other or the player character. The player and NPC's can interact with each other and their environment. Gameplay will be influenced by the type of terrain on the map, items that are equipped by the characters, and character stats. An experience system is in place so that as the players progress they can level up and change their stats according to their preferred style of gameplay. 

## Help
